		I am a sentence that contains some <strong>boldface</strong> text and 
		some <em>italic</em> text.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left;">This is a practice paragraph that contains multiple sentences. 
		A longer paragraph like this will allow me to see <em>word wrap</em> in action 
		in my web browser. Word wrap means that the text will wrap to fit the width of
		the browser window. So long as the browser window is a reasonable width, text 
		will not shoot off past the right edge of the window forcing me to scroll to the 
		right to see it. The wrapping occurs at spaces between words at the ends of lines.
		That prevents any individual word from being split across two lines.
